**Taxi Fare Estimation Model**

This repository contains the code and resources for a machine learning project focused on estimating taxi fares. The project includes data exploration, preprocessing, and the implementation of various regression models using scikit-learn. The best-performing model, a Random Forest Regressor, is used for predicting taxi fares on a test dataset.

Key Features:
1. Supervised regression problem
2. Multiple regression models explored (Linear, Polynomial, Decision Tree, Bagging, Random Forest)
3. Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning for model evaluation
4. Comprehensive data visualization and exploration

Stack:
1. Python
2. Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

Feel free to explore, contribute, and improve the model for more accurate taxi fare estimation!
